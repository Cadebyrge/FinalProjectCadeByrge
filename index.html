                            I work with a group of refugee artists. They create digital art using AI.
                            These refugees have fled their countries and now reside in the Kakuma Refugee Camp.
                            Each artist has created art that has been purchased here in the U.S.A in order to Light the World 
                            this Christmas season.
                            You can find some of their art through my scratch page.

                            Spanish Teacher - 
                        
                            I have worked at the Missionary Training Center for over a year now. I teach Spanish to missionaries
                            from all over the world. They come to the Provo MTC to learn Spanish for 6 weeks, then they go forth to service
                            throughout all the world.

                            <br>
                            Sales Associate - I spent some time working as a sales representative at Deseret Book. Every day I met new customers and got to help
                            new people. Each day was different as I spent time at the registers, restocking, and adapting to people's needs.
                            I learned how to communicate effectively and how to help people in need.

                            Counselor - Every week during the summer I got to be a counselor for a new group of youth.
                            Every week was different as the needs of the youth changed. I learned how to create a space where 
                            people feel comfortable to be themselves. This job taught me the importance of relationships. We need people and they need us.
                            It is time to start sharing that with the world.
